## Online Shop

For the moment, we will use mock data across all components. The data will be defined locally in the component's file.
>
> Create a new React Component for displaying a single product's details.
>
> Create a React component for displaying a list of products. Hint: keep in mind that you have to add the `key` attribute, use the `map` call on the array of products
>
> Add some CSS to each of the components to make them look nicer (following the mockup structure).
>
> To test them, add them to the `App.tsx` just to view them.
