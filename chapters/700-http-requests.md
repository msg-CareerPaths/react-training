## Online Shop

Note you should create some `Service` classes instead of calling fetch directly in your components.

> Use Fetch to read the products from the backend to fill in the product list.
>
> When navigating to the product detail page, read the product information from the backend.
>
> Add a new "Delete" button on the detail page, which calls the backend to remove a product from the catalogue.
>
> Add a new "Checkout" button on the shopping cart page, which creates a new order on the backend.
