## 2.1 Components

**Goal**: get a grip on the basics of React Components.

**Required Reading**:

- [Introduction to JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) (similar to TSX which we will use)
- [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)
- [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- [Styling and CSS](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#how-do-i-add-css-classes-to-components)
- [Functional Components vs Class Components](https://www.twilio.com/blog/react-choose-functional-components)

**Online Shop**:

> For the moment, we will use mock data across all components. The data will be defined locally in the component's file.
>
> Create a new React Component for displaying a single product's details.
>
> Create an React component for displaying a list of products. Hint: use the `.map` call on the array of products.
>
> Add some CSS to each of the components to make them look nicer.
