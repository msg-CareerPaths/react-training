## 4.1 Axios

**Goal**: communicate with your backend application using Axios.

**Required Reading**:

- [React: State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- [Axios Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Axios with Typescript](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-http-request-axios)
- [How to fetch data in React with Axios](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data)

**Online Shop**:

> Use Axios to read the products from the backend to fill in the product list.
>
> When navigating to the product detail page, read the product information from the backend.
>
> Add a new "Delete" button on the detail page, which calls the backend to remove a product from the catalogue.
>
> Add a new "Checkout" button on the shopping cart page, which creates a new order on the backend.
